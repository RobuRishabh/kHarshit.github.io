> "The key issue for me is finding the right definitions; finding the right notions that really capture the essence of some mathematical phenomenon. I often have some vague vision of what I want to understand, but I'm often missing the words to really say that. But then sometimes I read some other paper, and there is this definition, and suddenly it clicks and suddenly, I can say what I always wanted to say."
