From today, I'll start technical writing. I have never written blog posts before, though I always wanted to. To be able to write has been the primary purpose and motivation for building this blog for me.

I don't know if any of it would be well-written. All I am sure of is that I am going to write, just once a week - mostly on Fridays. That's why I have named it *Technical Fridays*. I chose Friday because that's the day I find time to pursue my hobbies after college hours. And, also because Github recently launched an initiative *Open Source Friday*<sup id="a1">[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>, a program for contributing to open source. Although there is hardly any relation between my blog posts and Github's initiative, I would get an excuse to write; after all I'm going to write about technical stuff ;)

Recently, I've started learning *R*<sup id="a2">[2](#myfootnote2)</sup> for data science. So, maybe I'll start writing about what I'm learning. In this way, I'm going to learn better.

I'm excited about this adventurous journey of writing.
