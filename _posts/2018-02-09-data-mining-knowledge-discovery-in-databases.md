Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) is a 7 step process to search for hidden knowledge in data. *Data Mining* refers to the analysis step in the *KDD* process.

When we're working on a data science project, we're performing some kind of KDD process with the objective of solving a problem. *Data science* is, infact, multidisciplinary. Everything from data mining to visualizing results is data science.

*Machine learning*, on the other hand, is a technique broadly used in data mining (thus in data science) to build models based on data so that it can predict the future outcomes.

The term *data science* is relatively new compared to others. Normally, the terms data mining and KDD are used synonymously.
