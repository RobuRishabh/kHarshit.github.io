Backpropagation is an efficient method of computing gradients in directed graphs of computations, such as neural networks. This is not a learning method, but rather a nice computational trick which is often used in learning methods. This is actually a simple implementation of chain rule of derivatives.

We can visually use backpropagation using computational graphs.
