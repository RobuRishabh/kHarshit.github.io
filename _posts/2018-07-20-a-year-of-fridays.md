It's been a year since I started this blog, [Technical Fridays]({% post_url 2017-07-21-technical-fridays %}). It has been an excellent journey. I learned a lot by writing here.

In the last year, I have written on a variety of [topics]({{site.baseurl}}/categories) ranging from statistics and machine learning to algorithms and cryptography. While a few posts were easy to write, some turned out to be a bit challenging for me but, the reason I had to write always encouraged me to learn more.

I'm content that I started this blog. It sure was an adventurous journey. I intend to write even more in the coming year.
