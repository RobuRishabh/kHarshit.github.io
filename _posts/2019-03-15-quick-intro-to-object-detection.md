Object detection deals with the detection of object instances in an image. There are a number of methods to accomplish it. The following post summarizes few important object detection methods.

## Classification and Localization

This method treats object detection as a regression problem.

## Sliding window

This method treats object detection as a classification problem.

The region based methods i.e. region-proposal:  

* R-CNN
* Fast R-CNN
* Faster R-CNN
* Mask R-CNN *(instance segmentation)*

Detection without proposals:  

* YOLO (You Only Look Once)
* SSD (Single Shot Detection)
