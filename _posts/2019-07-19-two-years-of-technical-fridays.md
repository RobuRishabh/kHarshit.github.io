It's been two years since I started writing this blog, [Technical Fridays]({% post_url 2017-07-21-technical-fridays %}), [A Year of Fridays]({% post_url 2018-07-20-a-year-of-fridays %}).

In the last year (July 20, 2018 - July 19, 2019), the site had 10,099 users from all over the world. That's an incredible achievement. Thank you all :)

For the past few months, I've been working mainly in the field of [Computer Vision]({{site.baseurl}}/categories/#computer-vision), so I expect to write more blog posts related to it. Once again, thank you to all the readers, it has been an incredible journey so far, and I hope to continue writing on some of the amazing topics in the future.
